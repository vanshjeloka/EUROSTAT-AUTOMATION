EUROSTAT-AUTOMATION


The organization aimed to analyze international trade trends by using country-level import and export data from the Eurostat portal. Traditionally, this was done by manually downloading trade data files from the website for each country, filtering the required information, and combining it for analysis. Due to time constraints, analysis was typically limited to yearly data, which often missed short-term trends and fluctuations
Each cycle of collecting, cleaning, and analyzing the data took approximately 2-4 hours per country. This inefficiency made frequent analysis difficult and limited the ability to act on current trends. The lack of monthly insights and the overhead of manual processing slowed down decision-making.

An automated data processing pipeline was created using Python. The tool collects, consolidates, and cleans monthly import/export data across countries, formats the data uniformly, and integrates it with external economic indicators. It outputs three sheets: a structured consolidated dataset, a country-specific market analysis (Import net of Export), and a yearly summary sheet that retains month-wise details. The output is precise, consistent, and ready for decision-making within 20 minutes for multiple countries.

This solution enables the shift from annual reporting to high-frequency, monthly data analysis. The improvement in data precision and timeliness allows for more proactive trade planning and market evaluation. Because the process is fully automated, analysis can now be repeated more frequently with minimal effort, enabling the sales departments in each respective country to respond more swiftly and strategically, leveraging detailed data to drive growth and strengthen market presence with greater confidence.
